Tomcat Directory Layout
/bin Stores executable files for Windows/*nix systems to start and stop server.
/conf Stores configuration files.
/lib Stores libraries to share between all applications. By default, only Tomcat libraries are in this directory.
/logs Stores Tomcat log files.
/temp Stores temporary files created using the Java File API.
/webapps Deploys .war files or exploded web applications.
/work Stores intermediate files (such as compiled JSP files) during its work.

 Ports Tomcat Uses
    8080, HTTP
    8443, HTTPS
    8005, shutdown service (disable this, see Standard HTTP/HTTPS ports and Root Permissions, below)
    8009, AJP connector, tomcat's half of mod_proxy_ajp, (not recommended for performance)
    use netstat -nlp to check for other processes using these ports
    edit ports in tomcat/conf/server.xml Server/Service/Connector tags
        except for shutdown port, in tomcat/conf/server.xml Server tag
        disable shutdown port (set to "-1"), use kill -15 instead 
    to run tomcat on port 80 as not-root-user, use ip tables to forward port 80 to 8080
    for more running tomcat on port 80, see
    Jason Brittain's blog

Scripts In tomcat/bin
    tomcat/bin/catalina.sh does the real work
    tomcat/bin/startup.sh to start tomcat, invokes catalina.sh
    tomcat/bin/shutdown.sh to stop tomcat, invokes catalina.sh
    tomcat/bin/version.sh to list tomcat-specific environment variables and version numbers, invokes catalina.sh 

Logs In tomcat/logs
    typically date-stamped, rolled over each time restarted
    STDOUT (main tomcat server stuff) in tomcat/logs/catalina.out
    rollover STDOUT logs in tomcat/logs/catalina._yyyy-mm-dd_.log
    individual webapps in tomcat/logs/_webappname_._yyyy-mm-dd_.log 

Config Files In Tomcat (mostly in tomcat/conf) you usually do mess with
    tomcat/conf/server.xml, controls tomcat server-level stuff, like ports
    tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml, edit to insert users for tomcat manager app
    tomcat/webapps/_webappname_/WEB-INF/web.xml, webapp-internal configs for a specific webapp
    tomcat/conf/Catalina/localhost/_webappname_.xml, server-level configs for a specific webapp
    auto-created when tomcat is started, using tomcat/webapps/_webappname_/META-INF/context.xml if present, else default context values in tomcat/conf/context.xml 

Config Files In tomcat/conf you usually don't mess with
    tomcat/conf/context.xml, default values for server-level webapp configs, seldom changed, overridden by webapp-specific context xml file (see above)
    tomcat/conf/web.xml, default values for webapp configs, seldom changed, overridden by webapp-specific web.xml file (see above)
    tomcat/conf/logging.properties, controls tomcat logging details, seldom changed
    tomcat/conf/catalina.properties, tomcat internal classloader configs, don't mess with it.
    tomcat/conf/catalina.policy, tomcat internal security policy, don't mess with it.
